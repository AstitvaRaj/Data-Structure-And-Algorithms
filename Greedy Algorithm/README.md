# Greedy Algorithms

## Introduction
Greedy algorithms are a class of algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. They are used for solving optimization problems.

## Key Concepts
- **Greedy Choice Property**: A global optimum can be arrived at by selecting a local optimum.
- **Optimal Substructure**: An optimal solution to the problem contains an optimal solution to subproblems.

## Common Problems
1. **Activity Selection Problem**
2. **Knapsack Problem (Fractional)**
3. **Huffman Coding**
4. **Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree**
5. **Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree**
6. **Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm**

## Standard Questions
1. **Activity Selection Problem**: Given a set of activities with start and end times, select the maximum number of activities that don't overlap.
2. **Fractional Knapsack Problem**: Given weights and values of items, determine the maximum value that can be put in a knapsack of a fixed capacity.
3. **Huffman Coding**: Given a set of characters and their frequencies, construct a Huffman tree and determine the codes for each character.

## Mixed Concept Questions
1. **Job Sequencing with Deadlines**: Given a set of jobs with deadlines and profits, find the sequence of jobs that maximizes total profit.
2. **Minimum Number of Platforms Required**: Given arrival and departure times of trains, find the minimum number of platforms required at the railway station.
3. **Optimal Merge Pattern**: Given a set of files with sizes, find the minimum cost to merge all files into one file.

## Conclusion
Greedy algorithms are powerful tools for solving a variety of optimization problems. Understanding the greedy choice property and optimal substructure is key to applying these algorithms effectively.
