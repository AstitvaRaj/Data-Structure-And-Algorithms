# Graph Theory and Algorithms

## Introduction
Graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph is made up of vertices (also called nodes) connected by edges.

## Types of Graphs
- **Undirected Graph**: A graph in which edges have no direction.
- **Directed Graph (Digraph)**: A graph in which edges have a direction.
- **Weighted Graph**: A graph in which edges have weights.
- **Unweighted Graph**: A graph in which edges do not have weights.

## Graph Representation
- **Adjacency Matrix**: A 2D array of size VxV where V is the number of vertices.
- **Adjacency List**: An array of lists. The size of the array is equal to the number of vertices.

## Graph Traversal Algorithms
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

## Shortest Path Algorithms
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: An algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph.
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: An algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights.

## Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms
- **Kruskal's Algorithm**: An algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph.
- **Prim's Algorithm**: An algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph.

## Topological Sorting
- **Kahn's Algorithm**: An algorithm for topological sorting of a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
- **Depth-First Search (DFS) Based Algorithm**: Another method for topological sorting using DFS.

## Conclusion
Graph theory and algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are used in various applications such as network analysis, scheduling, and optimization problems.
